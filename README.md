# Project Scrum Extension for Odoo 18

## Overview

This module **extends the Odoo Project Management app** to support **SCRUM methodology** by introducing:

* A new project type: `Scrum`
* Sprints as a new model, related to tasks
* Story Points on tasks
* Automatic creation and management of SCRUM stages
* Enhanced kanban and form views for SCRUM fields
* Advanced search and filtering

---

## Features

### 1. Project Type

* Adds a `project_type` field (`standard`/`scrum`) on projects.
* Selecting `Scrum`:

  * Automatically sets up SCRUM stages on the project's kanban board (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, etc).
  * Enables SCRUM-specific fields and functionalities on tasks.

### 2. Sprints

* New model: `project.sprint`

  * **Fields**: `name`, `date_start`, `date_end`
  * Sprints are assignable to tasks.

### 3. Story Points

* Adds a `story_points` integer field on tasks, visible only for Scrum projects.

### 4. Enhanced Task Views

* **Form view**:

  * Shows `story_points` and `sprint_id` only for tasks in Scrum projects.
* **Kanban view**:

  * Displays story points and sprint for Scrum tasks.
* **Search view**:

  * Filter tasks by presence of sprint assignment.

### 5. SCRUM Stages Management

* When a project is switched to `Scrum`, the system:

  * Ensures the creation (or correct ordering) of the following task stages:

    * Backlog, Stories Todo, Task Todo, Subtask Todo, Stories In Progress, Task In Progress, Subtask In Progress, Stories Done, Task Done, Subtask Done
  * Links these stages exclusively to the Scrum project.
  * Adjusts sequence and linking as needed.

### 6. Related Project Type on Tasks

* Each task gets a `project_type` field (readonly), useful for views and domain logic.

## Models & Fields

### 1. `project.project` (extended)

| Field         | Type      | Description           |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| project\_type | Selection | 'standard' or 'scrum' |

#### Methods

* `get_latest_sprint_id`: Returns the most recently created sprint's ID.
* `write`: When project\_type changes to 'scrum', ensures SCRUM stages.
* `_ensure_scrum_stages`: Creates/reorders/link SCRUM stages on `project.task.type` for this project.

---

### 2. `project.sprint` (new model)

| Field       | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- |
| name        | Char | Sprint name |
| date\_start | Date | Start date  |
| date\_end   | Date | End date    |

---

### 3. `project.task` (extended)

| Field         | Type     | Description               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| story\_points | Integer  | Story Points (SCRUM only) |
| sprint\_id    | Many2one | Linked Sprint             |
| project\_type | Related  | Project's type (readonly) |

---

## Views & UI

### Project Form

* Adds `project_type` just after project name.

### Task Kanban

* Loads and displays `story_points`, `sprint_id`, and `project_type`.
* Card template: If project\_type is 'scrum', shows story points and sprint in the kanban card.

### Task Form

* Inside the form, a group with:

  * `story_points` (visible only if project is scrum)
  * `sprint_id` (visible only if project is scrum)

### Task Search

* Adds a "Sprint" filter: shows only tasks linked to a sprint.

---

## Business Logic Details

* **Switching to Scrum**:

  * Existing project tasks are not modified, but new stages are created and associated.
* **Stages**:

  * If a stage already exists by name, it will be reused and sequence updated.
  * Otherwise, it is created and linked to the project.
* **Task Views**:

  * Scrum-specific fields are invisible for standard projects.

---

## Installation

1. Place the module in your Odoo addons folder:
   `project_scrum/`
2. Update the Odoo app list.
3. Install the module from the Odoo Apps menu.

---

## Usage

1. **Create or open a project**.
2. Set **Tipo di Progetto** to `Scrum` and save.

   * SCRUM stages will be set up automatically.
3. Create tasks in your project.

   * For SCRUM projects, each task form and kanban card will now include:

     * Story Points
     * Sprint assignment
4. Go to **Configuration â†’ Sprints** to manage sprints.
5. Assign tasks to sprints and set story points for each.

---

## Security and Compatibility

* Compatible with **Odoo 18** and the official `project` module.
* Follows Odoo security and ORM best practices.

---

## Extension & Customization

* Add more SCRUM fields as needed (e.g., Acceptance Criteria, Burndown).
* Integrate with other agile modules or custom workflows.

---

## Changelog

* **v1.0**

  * Initial release: SCRUM extension, sprints, story points, stages logic, enhanced views.
